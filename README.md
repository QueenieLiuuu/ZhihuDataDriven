# Data-driven Approach for Quality Evaluation on Knowledge Sharing Platform

## Introduction
Knowledge sharing plays a significant role in knowledge acquisition for ordinary people,
however, due to the insufficient evaluation schemes, people suffer from lots of low-level
knowledge services, which overwhelm the platform as well.

In our paper, we propose a deep learning-based model to automatically predict a Zhihu Live's
score. Our proposed ```MTB-DNN``` achieves the best performance among baseline models.

MAE | RMSE    
:-: | :-:  
0.29954 | 0.40114
